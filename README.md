// by Infusion Systems Ltd. 
// 
// This Arduino sketch emulates some features of the firmware that runs on I-CubeX digitizers, 
// and allows you to use the Arduino, or rather "iCubino", with I-CubeX software that uses host mode: 
// Link, SensePlay, and various plugins. In all cases the I-CubeX Connect serial to MIDI mapping 
// software utility is required. Intended for use with the Uno and the I-CubeX Shield 
// (http://icubex.com/shield) that easily connects I-CubeX sensors to an Arduino.
