# iCubino

An Arduino sketch to emulate host mode of I-CubeX digitizers.

This Arduino sketch emulates some features of the firmware that runs on I-CubeX digitizers, and allows you to use the Arduino, or rather "iCubino", with I-CubeX software that uses host mode: Link, SensePlay, and various plugins. In all cases the I-CubeX Connect serial to MIDI mapping software utility is required. See also http://icubex.com/icubino.
